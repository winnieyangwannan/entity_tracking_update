    "This notebook / document is built around the [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper, in which the authors aim to understand the **indirect object identification circuit** in GPT-2 small.

    "It is loosely divided into different sections, each one with their own flavour. Sections 1, 2 & 3 are derived from Neel Nanda's notebook [Exploratory_Analysis_Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/activation_patching_in_TL_demo.py.ipynb#scrollTo=uw7PmPbLuzVO). The flavour of these exercises is experimental and loose, with a focus on demonstrating what exploratory analysis looks like in practice with the transformerlens library. They skimp on rigour, and instead try to speedrun the process of finding suggestive evidence for this circuit. The code and exercises are simple and generic, but accompanied with a lot of detail about what each stage is doing, and why (plus several optional details and tangents). Section 4 introduces you to the idea of **path patching**, which is a more rigorous and structured way of analysing the model's behaviour. Here, you'll be replicating some of the results of the paper, which will serve to rigorously validate the insights gained from earlier sections. It's the most technically dense of all five sections. Lastly, sections 5 & 6 are much less structured, and have a stronger focus on open-ended exercises & letting you go off and explore for yourself.\n",

    "* You want to get a sense of how to do exploratory analysis on a model - **1, 2, 3**\n",

    "A key idea to have in mind during these exercises is the **spectrum from simpler, more exploratory tools to more rigoruous, complex tools**. On the simpler side, you have something like inspecting attention patterns, which can give a decent (but sometimes misleading) picture of what an attention head is doing. These should be some of the first tools you reach for, and you should be using them a lot even before you have concrete hypotheses about a circuit. On the more rigorous side, you have something like path patching, which is a pretty rigorous and effortful tool that is best used when you already have reasonably concrete hypotheses about a circuit. As we go through the exercises, we'll transition from left to right along this spectrum.\n"

    "## The IOI task\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when trying to reverse engineer a circuit in a model is to identify *what* capability we want to reverse engineer. Indirect Object Identification is a task studied in Redwood Research's excellent [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper (see [Neel Nanda's interview with the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) or [Kevin Wang's Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587601532639494146.html) for an overview). The task is to complete sentences like \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \" Mary\" rather than \" John\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper they rigorously reverse engineer a 26 head circuit, with 7 separate categories of heads used to perform this capability. The circuit they found roughly breaks down into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify what names are in the sentence\n",
    "2. Identify which names are duplicated\n",
    "3. Predict the name that is *not* duplicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was this task chosen? The authors give a very good explanation for their choice in their [video walkthrough of their paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo), which you are encouraged to watch. To be brief, some of the reasons were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a fairly common grammatical structure, so we should expect the model to build some circuitry for solving it quite early on (after it's finished with all the more basic stuff, like n-grams, punctuation, induction, and simpler grammatical structures than this one).\n",
    "* It's easy to measure: the model always puts a much higher probability on the IO and S tokens (i.e. `\" Mary\"` and `\" John\"`) than any others, and this is especially true once the model starts being stripped down to the core part of the circuit we're studying. So we can just take the logit difference between these two tokens, and use this as a metric for how well the model can solve the task.\n",
    "* It is a crisp and well-defined task, so less likely to be solved in terms of memorisation of a large bag of heuristics (unlike e.g. tasks like \"predict that the number `n+1` will follow `n`, which as Neel mentions in the video walkthrough is actually much more annoying and subtle than it first seems!).\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminology note: `IO` will refer to the indirect object (in the example, `\" Mary\"`), `S1` and `S2` will refer to the two instances of the subject token (i.e. `\" John\"`), and `end` will refer to the end token `\" to\"` (because this is the position we take our prediction from, and we don't care about any tokens after this point). We will also sometimes use `S` to refer to the identity of the subject token (rather than referring to the first or second instance in particular).\n"

    "## Keeping track of your guesses & predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot to keep track of in these exercises as we work through them. You'll be exposed to new functions and modules from transformerlens, new ways to causally intervene in models, all the while building up your understanding of how the IOI task is performed. The notebook starts off exploratory in nature (lots of plotting and investigation), and gradually moves into more technical details, refined analysis, and replication of the paper's results, as we improve our understanding of the IOI circuit. You are recommended to keep a document or page of notes nearby as you go through these exercises, so you can keep track of the main takeaways from each section, as well as your hypotheses for how the model performs the task, and your ideas for how you might go off and test these hypotheses on your own if the notebook were to suddenly end.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling extremely confused at any point, you can come back to the dropdown below, which contains diagrams explaining how the circuit works. There is also an accompanying intuitive explanation which you might find more helpful. However, I'd recommend you try and go through the notebook unassisted before looking at these.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Intuitive explanation of IOI circuit</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's start with an analogy for how transformers work (you can skip this if you've already read [my post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/euam65XjigaCJQkcN/an-analogy-for-understanding-transformers)). Imagine a line of people, who can only look forward. Each person has a token written on their chest, and their goal is to figure out what token the person in front of them is holding. Each person is allowed to pass a question backwards along the line (not forwards), and anyone can choose to reply to that question by passing information forwards to the person who asked. In this case, the sentence is `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`. You are the person holding the `\" to\"` token, and your goal is to figure out that the person in front of him has the `\" Mary\"` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear about how this analogy relates to transformers:\n",
    "* Each person in the line represents a vector in the residual stream. Initially they just store their own token, but they accrue more information as they ask questions and receive answers (i.e. as components write to the residual stream)\n",
    "* The operation of an attention head is represented by a question & answer:\n",
    "    * The person who asks is the destination token, the people who answer are the source tokens\n",
    "    * The question is the query vector\n",
    "    * The information *which determines who answers the question* is the key vector\n",
    "    * The information *which gets passed back to the original asker* is the value vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here is how the IOI circuit works in this analogy. Each bullet point represents a class of attention heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person with the second `\" John\"` token asks the question \"does anyone else hold the name `\" John\"`?\". They get a reply from the first `\" John\"` token, who also gives him their location. So he now knows that `\" John\"` is repeated, and he knows that the first `\" John\"` token is 4th in the sequence.\n",
    "    * These are *Duplicate Token Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"which names are repeated?\", and you get an answer from the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. You now also know that `\" John\"` is repeated, and where the first `\" John\"` token is.\n",
    "    * These are *S-Inhibition Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\". You get a reply from the person holding the `\" Mary\"` token, who tells you that they have name `\" Mary\"`. You use this as your prediction.\n",
    "    * These are *Name Mover Heads*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fine first-pass understanding of how the circuit works. A few other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person after the first `\" John\"` (holding `\" went\"`) had previously asked about the identity of the person behind him. So he knows that the 4th person in the sequence holds the `\" John\"` token, meaning he can also reply to the question of the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. *(previous token heads / induction heads)*\n",
    "    * This might not seem necessary, but since previous token heads / induction heads are just a pretty useful thing to have in general, it makes sense that you'd want to make use of this information!\n",
    "* If for some reason you forget to ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\", then you'll have another chance to do this.\n",
    "    * These are *(Backup Name Mover Heads)*\n",
    "    * Their existance might be partly because transformers are trained with **dropout**. This can make them \"forget\" things, so it's important to have a backup method for recovering that information!\n",
    "* You want to avoid overconfidence, so you also ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\" another time, in order to ***anti-***predict the response that you get from this question. *(negative name mover heads)*\n",
    "    * Yes, this is as weird as it sounds! The authors speculate that these heads \"hedge\" the predictions, avoiding high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.\n",

So if we perform singular value decomposition $W_Q W_K^T = U S V^T$, then we see that we can just as easily define $W_Q = U \\sqrt{S}$ and $W_K = V \\sqrt{S}$ and use these instead. This means that $W_Q$ and $W_K$ both have orthogonal columns with matching norms. You can investigate this yourself (e.g. using the code below).

    "We now want to find a reference prompt to run the model on. Even though our ultimate goal is to reverse engineer how this behaviour is done in general, often the best way to start out in mechanistic interpretability is by zooming in on a concrete example and understanding it in detail, and only *then* zooming out and verifying that our analysis generalises. In section 3, we'll work with a dataset similar to the one used by the paper authors, but this probably wouldn't be the first thing we reached for if we were just doing initial investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run the model on 4 instances of this task, each prompt given twice - one with the first name as the indirect object, one with the second name. To make our lives easier, we'll carefully choose prompts with single token names and the corresponding names in the same token positions.\n",

    "We want models that can take in arbitrary text, but models need to have a fixed vocabulary. So the solution is to define a vocabulary of **tokens** and to deterministically break up arbitrary text into tokens. Tokens are, essentially, subwords, and are determined by finding the most frequent substrings - this means that tokens vary a lot in length and frequency!\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are a *massive* headache and are one of the most annoying things about reverse engineering language models... Different names will be different numbers of tokens, different prompts will have the relevant tokens at different positions, different prompts will have different total numbers of tokens, etc. Language models often devote significant amounts of parameters in early layers to convert inputs from tokens to a more sensible internal format (and do the reverse in later layers). You really, really want to avoid needing to think about tokenization wherever possible when doing exploratory analysis (though, of course, it's relevant later when trying to flesh out your analysis and make it rigorous!). HookedTransformer comes with several helper methods to deal with tokens: `to_tokens, to_string, to_str_tokens, to_single_token, get_token_position`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** I recommend using `model.to_str_tokens` to explore how the model tokenizes different strings. In particular, try adding or removing spaces at the start, or changing capitalization - these change tokenization!</details>\n"

I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (e.g. the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending to a single John token. So this will be pretty hard to figure out on the \" to\" token!\n",

This feels easier done with a non-linearity, since precisely cancelling out vectors is hard, so I'd imagine an MLP layer deletes the `\" John\"` direction of the residual stream.\n",

    "\n",
    "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from `\" John\"` to `\" John\"`, and whose outputs are then moved to the `\" to\"` token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",
    "\n",

Further, each attention layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each head (See [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) for details), and each MLP layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each neuron (and a bias term for each layer).\n",

    "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",
    "\n",

And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant. See [my clean GPT-2 implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Clean_Transformer_Implementation) for more on LayerNorm.\n",

Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour.\n",

    "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",

For example, the model is likely intitially doing some processing on the `S2` token to realise that it's a duplicate, but then uses attention to move that information to the `end` token. So patching in the residual stream at the `end` token will likely matter a lot in later layers but not at all in early layers.\n",

    "We can zoom in much further and patch in specific activations from specific layers.

    "\n",
    "**Second important note** - we've defined this to be 0 when performance is the same as on corrupted input, and 1 when it's the same as on clean input. Why have we done it this way around? The answer is that, in this section, we'll be applying **denoising** rather than **noising** methods. **Denoising** means we start with the corrupted input (i.e. no signal, or negative signal) and patch in with the clean input (i.e. positive signal). This is an important conceptual distinction. When we perform denoising, we're looking for parts of the model which are **sufficient** for the task (e.g. which parts of the model have enough information to recover the correct answer from the corrupted input). Our \"null hypothesis\" is that a part of the model isn't important, and so changing its value won't get us from corrupted to clean values. On the other hand, **noising** means taking a clean run and patching in with corrupted values, and it tests whether a component is **necessary**. Our \"null hypothesis\" is that a component isn't important, and so replacing its values with those on the corrupted input won't make the model worse. In this section, we'll be doing denoising (i.e. starting with corrupted values and patching in with clean values). In later sections, we'll be doing noising, and we'll define a new metric function for this.\n",

    "Although algorithms like activation and path patching generally use noising, it has some problems relative to denoising.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of denoising are much stronger, because showing that a component or set of components is sufficient for a task is a big deal. On the other hand, the complexity of transformers and interdependence of components means that noising a model can have unpredictable consequences. If loss goes up when we ablate a component, it doesn't necessarily mean that this component was necessary for the task. As an example, ablating MLP0 in gpt2-small seems to make performance much worse on basically any task (because it acts as a kind of extended embedding; more on this later in these exercises), but it's not doing anything important which is *specfic* for the IOI task.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Hook functions take arguments `tensor: t.Tensor` and `hook: HookPoint`. It's often easier to define a hook function taking more arguments than these, and then use `functools.partial` when it actually comes time to add your hook.\n",

    "    * The tokens to run (as first argument)\n",
    "    * `fwd_hooks` - a list of `(hook_name, hook_fn)` tuples. Remember that you can use `utils.get_act_name` to get hook names.\n",
    "* Tip - it's good practice to have `model.reset_hooks()` at the start of functions which add and run hooks. This is because sometimes hooks fail to be removed (if they cause an error while running). There's nothing more frustrating than fixing a hook error only to get the same error message, not realising that you've failed to clear the broken hook!\n"

    "As with direct logit attribution, layer 9 is positive and layers 10 and 11 are not, suggesting that the late layers only matter for direct logit effects, but we also see that layers 7 and 8 matter significantly. Presumably these are the heads that move information about which name is duplicated from `S2` to `END`.\n",

    "In contrast, the MLP layers do not matter much. This makes sense, since this is more a task about moving information than about processing it, and the MLP layers specialise in processing information. The one exception is MLP 0, which matters a lot, but I think this is misleading and just a generally true statement about MLP 0 rather than being about the circuit on this task.\n",

    "It's often observed on GPT-2 Small that MLP0 matters a lot, and that ablating it utterly destroys performance. My current best guess is that the first MLP layer is essentially acting as an extension of the embedding (for whatever reason) and that when later layers want to access the input tokens they mostly read in the output of the first MLP layer, rather than the token embeddings. Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much.\n",

    "\n",
    "I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but I would guess that it's because the embedding and unembedding matrices in GPT-2 Small are the same. This is pretty unprincipled, as the tasks of embedding and unembedding tokens are <i>not</i> inverses, but this is common practice, and plausibly models want to dedicate some parameters to overcoming this.\n",

    "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [Neel's walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition.\n"

    "\n",
    "Rather than just having duplicate token heads in the first cluster of heads, we have two other types of heads as well: previous token heads and induction heads. The induction heads do the same thing as the duplicate token heads, via an induction mechanism. They cause token `S2` to attend to `S1+1` (mediated by the previous token heads), and their output is used as both a pointer to `S1` and as a signal that `S1` is duplicated (more on the distinction between these two in the paragraph \"Position vs token information being moved\" below).\n",

    "\n",
    "Why are induction heads used in this circuit? We'll dig into this more in the bonus section, but one likely possibility is that induction heads are just a thing that forms very early on in training by default, and so it makes sense for the model to repurpose this already-existing machinery for this job. See [this paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) for more on induction heads, and how / why they form.\n"

It's not obvious why the model does this; the paper speculates that these heads might help the model \"hedge\" so as to avoid high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.\n",

    "Backup name mover heads are possibly even weirder. It turns out that when we **ablate** the name mover heads, these ones pick up the slack and do the task anyway (even though they don't seem to do it when the NMHs aren't ablated). This is an example of **built-in redundancy** in the model. One possible explanation is that this resulted from the model being trained with dropout, although this explanation isn't fully satisfying (models trained without dropout still seem to have BNMHs, although they aren't as strong as they are in this model).

    "When we did activation patching on the keys and values of S-inhibition heads, we found that the values were important and the keys weren't. We concluded that K-composition isn't really happening in these heads, and `END` must be paying attention to `S2` for reasons other than the duplicate token information (e.g. it might just be paying attention to the closest name, or to any names which aren't separated from it by a comma). Although this is mostly true, it turns out that there is a bit of K-composition happening in these heads. We can think of this as the duplicate token heads writing the \"duplicated\" flag to the residual stream (without containing any information about the identity and position of this token), and this flag is being used by the keys of the S-inhibition heads (i.e. they make `END` pay attention to `S2`). In the diagram, this is represented by the dark grey boxes (rather than just the light grey boxes we had in the simplified version). We haven't seen any evidence for this happening yet, but we will in the next section (when we look at path patching).\n",
    "\n",

    "Firstly, what dataset should we use for patching? In the previous section we just flipped the subject and indirect object tokens around, which meant the direction of the signal was flipped around. However, what we'll be doing here is a bit more principled - rather than flipping the IOI signal, we'll be erasing it. We do this by constructing a new dataset from `ioi_dataset` which replaces every name with a different random name. This way, the sentence structure stays the same, but all information related to the actual indirect object identification  task (i.e. the identities and positions of repeated names) has been erased.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given the sentence `\"When John and Mary went to the shops, John gave the bag to Mary\"`, the corresponding sentence in the ABC dataset might be `\"When Edward and Laura went to the shops, Adam gave the bag to Mary\"`. We would expect the residual stream for the latter prompt to carry no token or positional information which could help it solve the IOI task (i.e. favouring `Mary` over `John`, or favouring the 2nd token over the 4th token).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define this dataset below. Note the syntax of the `gen_flipped_prompts` method - the letters tell us how to replace the names in the sequence. For instance, `ABB->XYZ` tells us to take sentences of the form `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"` with `\"When [X] and [Y] went to the store, [Z] gave a drink to Mary\"` for 3 independent randomly chosen names `[X]`, `[Y]` and `[Z]`. We'll use this function more in the bonus section, when we're trying to disentangle positional and token signals (since we can also do fun things like `ABB->BAB` to swap the first two names, etc).\n"

The slightly longer answer is that both this method and a method which doesn't count MLPs as the direct path are justifiable.\n",

To oversimplify, we might imagine that `0.0` writes the vector $v$ into the residual stream, some neuron detects $v$ and writes $w$ to the residual stream, and `2.0` detects $w$. If we didn't count MLPs as a direct path then we wouldn't catch this causal relationship. The drawback is that things get a bit messier, because now we're essentially passing a \"fake input\" into our MLPs, and it's dangerous to assume that any operation as clean as the one previously described (with vectors $v$, $w$) would still happen under these new circumstances.\n",

Luckily, in the IOI circuit, MLPs aren't important (except for MLP0), and so doing both these forms of path patching get pretty similar results. As an optional exercise, you can reproduce the results from the following few sections using this different form of path patching.

    "Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴\n",
    "Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪\n",
    "\n",
    "You should spend up to 30-45 minutes on this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path patching is a very challenging algorithm with many different steps.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should implement path patching from heads to the residual stream, as described above (and in the paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is expected to be challenging, with several moving parts. We've purposefully left it very open-ended, without even giving you a docstring for the function you'll be writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few hints / tips for how to proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split your function up into 3 parts (one for each of the steps above), and write each section one at a time.\n",
    "* You'll need a new hook function: one which performs freezing / patching for step 2 of the algorithm.\n",
    "* You can reuse a lot of code from your activation patching function.\n",
    "* When calling `model.run_with_cache`, you can use the keyword argument `names_filter`, which is a function from name to boolean. If you use this argument, your model will only cache activtions with a name which passes this filter (e.g. you can use it like `names_filter = lambda name: name.endswith(\"q\")` to only cache query vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also look at the dropdowns to get more hints and guidance (e.g. if you want to start from a function docstring).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll know you've succeeded if you can plot the results, and replicate Figure 3(b) from [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00593.pdf) (at the top of page 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note - if you use `model.add_hook` then `model.run_with_cache`, you might have to pass the argument `level=1` to the `add_hook` method. I don't know why the function sometimes fails unless you do this (this bug only started appearing after the exercises were written). I've not had time to track this down, but extra credit to anyone who can (-:**"

Remember that in the diagram, grey represents original values (clean) and blue represents new values (corrupted), so e.g. in step 2 we want to run the model on `orig_dataset` (= IOI dataset) and we also want to freeze all non-sender heads to their values in `orig_cache`.\n",

Since attention heads' primary purpose is to move information around the model, it's reasonable to guess that this probably isn't happening.\n",

    "Now let's do a different kind of test of the name mover heads' copying, by looking directly at the OV circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "From page 6 of the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To check that the Name Mover Heads copy names generally, we studied what values are written via the heads’ OV matrix. Specifically, we first obtained the state of the residual stream at the position of each name token after the first MLP layer. Then, we multiplied this by the OV matrix of a Name Mover Head (simulating what would happen if the head attended perfectly to that token), multiplied by the unembedding matrix, and applied the final layer norm to obtain logit probabilities. We compute the proportion of samples that contain the input name token in the top 5 logits (N = 1000) and call this the copy score. All three Name Mover Heads have a copy score above 95%, compared to less than 20% for an average head.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Negative Name Mover Heads ... have a large negative copy score–the copy score calculated with the negative of the OV matrix (98% compared to 12% for an average head).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the similarity between their method and how we studied copying in induction heads, during an earlier set of exercises. However, there are differences (e.g. we're only looking at whether the head copies names, rather than whether it copies tokens in general).\n"

    "You should replicate these results by completing the `get_copying_scores` function below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could do this by indexing from the `ioi_cache`, but a much more principled alternative would be to embed all the names in the `NAMES` list and apply operations like MLPs, layernorms and OV matrices manually. This is what the solutions do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use `model.to_tokens` to convert the names to tokens. Remember to use `prepend_bos=False`, since you just want the tokens of names so you can embed them. Note that this function will treat the list of names as a batch of single-token inputs, which works fine for our purposes.\n",
    "* You can apply MLPs and layernorms as functions, by just indexing the model's blocks (e.g. use `model.blocks[i].mlp` or `model.blocks[j].ln1` as a function). Remember that `ln1` is the layernorm that comes before attention, and `ln2` comes before the MLP.\n",
    "* Remember that you need to apply MLP0 before you apply the OV matrix (which is why we omit the 0th layer in our scores). The reason for this is that ablating MLP0 has a strangely large effect in gpt2-small relative to ablating other MLPs, possibly because it's acting as an extended embedding (see [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/yivyHaCAmMJ3CqSyj/p/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd#:~:text=GPT%2D2%20Small%E2%80%99s%20performance%20is%20ruined%20if%20you%20ablate%20MLP0) for an explanation).\n",

To explain why intuitively, heads might be \"expecting\" non-zero input, and setting the input to zero is essentially an arbitrary choice which takes it off distribution. You can think of this as adding a bias term to this head, which might mess up subsequent computation and lead to noisy results. We could also use mean-ablation (i.e. set a head's output to its average output over `ioi_dataset`), but the problem here is that taking the mean over this dataset might contain relevant information for solving the IOI task. For example the `is_duplicated` flag which gets written to `S2` will be present for all sequences, so averaging won't remove this information.\n",

    "One implication of this is that it's useful to categories heads according to whether they occur in simpler circuits, so that as we look for more complex circuits we can easily look for them. This is Hooked to do here! An interesting fact about induction heads is that they work on a sequence of repeated random tokens - notable for being wildly off distribution from the natural language GPT-2 was trained on. Being able to predict a model's behaviour off distribution is a good mark of success for mechanistic interpretability! This is a good sanity check for whether a head is an induction head or not.\n",

    "We can characterise an induction head by just giving a sequence of random tokens repeated once, and measuring the average attention paid from the second copy of a token to the token after the first copy. At the same time, we can also measure the average attention paid from the second copy of a token to the first copy of the token, which is the attention that the induction head would pay if it were a duplicate token head, and the average attention paid to the previous token to find previous token heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a superficial study of whether something is an induction head - we totally ignore the question of whether it actually does boost the correct token or whether it composes with a single previous head and how. In particular, we sometimes get anti-induction heads which suppress the induction-y token (no clue why!), and this technique will find those too.\n"

    "After making the plot suggested in the hint, you should find that patching from `5.8` and `5.9` each have around a 5% negative impact on the logit difference if you patch from them to the S-inhibition heads. We'd like to conclude that these are induction heads, and they're acting to increase the attention paid by `end` to `S2`. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be induction heads according to the results of figure 18 in the paper (which we replicated in the section \"validation of early heads\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that they're acting as induction heads on this distribution, but not in general. A simple way we can support this hypothesis is to look at attention patterns (we find that `S2` pays attention to `S1+1` in both head `5.8` and `5.9`).\n",

    "In the dropdown above, I claimed that `5.8` and `5.9` were doing induction on this distribution. A more rigorous way to test this would be to path patch to the keys of these heads, and see if either of the previous token heads have a large effect. If they do, this is very strong evidence for induction. However, it turns out that neither of the prev token heads affect the model's IOI performance via their path through the fuzzy induction heads. Does this invalidate our hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, no, because of nonlinearity. The two prev token heads `2.2` and `4.11` will be adding onto the **logits** used to calculate the attention probability from `S2` to `S1+1`, rather than adding onto the probabilities directly. SO it might be the case that one head on its own doesn't increase the attention probability very much, both both heads acting together significantly increase it. (Motivating example: suppose we only had 2 possible source tokens, without either head acting the logits are `[0.0, -8.0]`, and the action of each head is to add `4.0` to the second logit. If one head acts then the probability on the second token goes from basically zero to `0.018` (which will have a very small impact on the attention head's output), but if both heads are acting then the logits are equal and the probability is `0.5` (which obviously has a much larger effect)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in fact what I found here - after modifying the path patching function to allow more than one sender head, I found that patching from both `2.2` and `4.11` to `5.8` and `5.9` had a larger effect on the model's IOI performance than patching from either head alone (about a 1% drop in performance for both vs almost 0% for either individually). The same effect can be found when we patch from these heads to all four induction heads, although it's even more pronounced (a 3% and 15% drop respectively for the heads individually, vs 31% for both).\n",

    "Another fascinating anomaly is that of the **backup name mover heads**. A standard technique to apply when interpreting model internals is ablations, or knock-out. If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, e.g. that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task. But it's still an Hooked technique to apply to give some data.\n",

This is illustrated in my IOI diagram, by purple vs pink boxes.\n",

If we run our model on the first sentence above but then patch in the second sentence, then:\n",

    "A few sanity checks, which are what we'd expect from this plot (and hence validate our code as probably being correct):\n",
    "\n",
    "* When token and positional signals are inverted, performance is close to negative of the original performance.\n",
    "* Inverting the positional signal makes performance worse.\n",
    "* Randomizing the token signal makes performance worse.\n",
    "* Inverting the token signal makes performance worse. This effect is larger than randomizing (because we're pointing away from a correct answer, rather than just in a random direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main interesting findings from this plot (which we might have guessed at beforehand, but couldn't have been certain about):\n",
    "* The row and column differences are close to constant (column diff is approx 4.5, row diff is approx 0.75). In other words, the logit diff can be well approximated by a linear combination of the positional and token signal correlations (where correlation is 1 if the signal points towards the correct value, -1 if it points away, and 0 if it points in a random direction).\n",
    "* The coefficients on the positional signal correlation is **much** bigger than the coefficient on the token signal correlation. The former is about 4.5, the latter is about 1.5. This tells us that positional information is a lot more important than token information.\n",
    "    * One possible intuition here is that name information (i.e. representing the identity of the token `\" John\"`) takes up many dimensions, so is probably harder for the model. Relative positional information on the other hand will mostly have fewer dimensions. Since the model only needs to move enough information to single out a single positional index from about 15-20, rather than single out a name in the entire set of names. This is jus a guess though, and I'd love to hear other interpretations.\n",
